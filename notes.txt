Pre-start One-time Fixes:
1) Run fix_low_overall_players to improve terrible players, get skating  and
	strength to reflect players size.
2) Run fix_all_players to standardize greed, penalty, faceoffs, etc.

League Start: 
1) Use 1.15b. Save once and close (no ceilings generated)
2) Copy potentials from startgame roster file to savegame roster file
3) Open game file, save it a second time (this generates ceilings)
4) Adjust some ceilings as you wish
5) Send 2001 draft picks back to CSB
    IDEAS FOR LEAGUE START:
    a) Start game in 1.18, save twice, generate ceilings
    b) Run "START GAME" script that:
        i)  copies potentials from startgame roster
        ii) generates custom made ceilings based on corrects pots


Draft: 
1.15b - 1. Subtract 10 from every skater pot (10% chance you don't subtract)
		2. Randomly generate goalie pots
		3. Convert all 30 pots to 60 pots
		4. Randomly generate all cons
		
Every Offseason:
(after draft, after newly generated staff):
-adjust scouts stats

(after schedule jump, june 30 to aug 1):
-adjust new prospect stats

Scoring level:
140 for Regular Season
120 for Playoffs

Penalties:
120 RS
100 POs

Fighting:
60 RS
20 POs

Draft Nationalites (add up to 1001):

Staff Tactics:
- Head Coach dictates Even Strength line tactics
- Staff running PP dictates PP line tactics
- Staff running SH dictates SH line tactics

EV:
	0 = Run and Gun			(RAG)			3ovr + 3skating + 4offense / 10
	1 = Passing Plays		(PP)			ovr + 3passing +
	2 = Dump and Chase		(DAC)			
	3 = Hit and Grind		(HAG)
	4 = Neutral Zone Trap	(NZT)
	
PP:
	0 = Shooting			(SH)
	1 = Screen and Shoot	(SAS)
	2 = Passing Plays		(PP)
	3 = Crash the Net		(CTN)
	4 = Shot from Point		(SFP)
	
SH:
	0 = Aggressive			(AGR)
	1 = Loose Box			(LB)
	2 = Passive Box			(PB)
	3 = Small Box			(SB)
	4 = Tight Box			(TB)
	
	
Lines:
	- Calculate rating for each player on roster at each position (1LW, 1C, 1RW, 2LW, 2C, 2RW, etc.)
	- Find which position has the largest discrepency between 1st and 2nd place ratings. Fill that position with player with 1st place rating.
	- Repeat for each of the 12 forward positions. Then repeat for Defense
	- For Goalies
		- backup plays proportional to overall ratio between backup and starter
		- endurance
		- back to backs (look at schedule)
    
Extra player attributes:
  - loyalty/desire to win/desire for money
  - attribute drop per position (consistency, marking, greed, potential)

Extra staff attributes:
  - potential
  - line strategies
  - ice time distribution
  - preference per position
  
  
Notes:
  - max # players = 3060?
    - 30 NHL orgs * 50 players = 1500
    - 217 non NHL/AHL teams for the remaining 1500 players ~ roughly 7 players per team
  - Player flux:
     - 7 draft rounds = 210 players
     - ~250 new players, ~250 retiring players each year
     - 15 and 16-year olds (i.e., players to be drafted two drafts from now) will be removed from current game file,
        placed in "High School" game file consisting of players 40 ovr
     - Number of players: age breakdown (age as of September, start of season)
